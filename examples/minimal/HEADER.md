# Minimal example

The smallest valid call: one workflow deployed whole from a portal-shaped template with a single
scalar token, a daily Recurrence trigger and one Compose action. The environment comes from the
Terraform workspace (`terraform.workspace`), not a variable.

Consumption workflows are free at rest and this one runs once a day for fractions of a penny, so
the example is safe to apply; `just e2e minimal` applies then always destroys it, and the CI
self-test does the same on manual dispatch.
